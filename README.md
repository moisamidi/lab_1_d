We try to compare two algorithms, Kruskal's algorithm by Polusytok Yulia and Floyd Worshall's algorithm by Yaremko Anna.
Approximate execution time of the Kruskal's algorithm 0.010331700090318918, and for Floyd Worshall's algorithm time is 0.008024599985219538. In conclusion, Kruskal works faster.
We can clearly see that prim's algorithms run faster than kruskal's. Nevertheless, the difference between them is smaller in sparse graphs (density 0.1) and bigger in dense graphs (density 0.9)
So, we can conclude that it's always more efficient to use Prim's algorithm, even for sparse graphs.
